# Project Scope Validator

A lightweight, browser-based application that guides you through defining and evaluating project scope to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment before you begin your next project. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool helps teams and individuals create well-structured project plans with confidence.

## What It Does

Project Scope Validator walks you through a comprehensive six-step process to define your project's essential elements: basic information, stakeholders, goals, timeline, responsibilities, and potential risks. After completing the wizard, you receive a calculated readiness score that highlights areas of strength and identifies aspects that need refinement before project launch.

The application runs entirely in your browser with no backend dependencies, storing your progress locally so you can return to complete your scope definition at any time. When finished, you can copy your project summary to the clipboard or generate a PDF for sharing with stakeholders.

## Getting Started

You can start using Project Scope Validator immediately by opening the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No installation, build process, or server setup is required.

**Quick Start:**
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser
3. Begin defining your project scope using the step-by-step wizard

The application works offline and stores your progress automatically as you work through each step. If you need to close your browser or navigate away, your data will be preserved when you return.

## Core Features

**Step-by-Step Wizard** guides you through six essential areas of project definition: project basics, key stakeholders, goals and success criteria, timeline with milestones, task responsibilities, and dependencies or risks. Each step includes helpful guidance text and validation to ensure you provide complete information.

**Intelligent Scoring System** evaluates your project readiness based on completeness of information, timeline balance, stakeholder involvement, and risk awareness. The scoring algorithm provides a percentage-based assessment with specific feedback on areas for improvement.

**Session Persistence** automatically saves your progress using browser storage, allowing you to complete your project scope over multiple sessions without losing data. Your current step and all entered information are preserved between browser sessions.

**Export Options** let you copy your complete project summary to the clipboard for easy sharing or generate a formatted PDF document suitable for stakeholder review and project documentation.

**Responsive Design** ensures the application works seamlessly across desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices with an interface optimized for touch interaction and various screen sizes.

## Development Setup

Setting up Project Scope Validator for development requires only a modern web browser and a text editor. The application uses no build tools, package managers, or external dependencies.

**Development Requirements:**
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Text editor or IDE of your choice
- Local web server (optional, for testing)

**Getting Started with Development:**
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/Subarudevboy/project-scope.git
2. Open the project folder in your preferred editor
3. Make your changes to `index.html`, `styles.css`, or `script.js`
4. Open `index.html` directly in your browser to test changes

For more advanced development workflows, you can serve the files using a local web server. Python users can run `python -m http.server 8000` in the project directory, while Node.js users can use `npx serve .` to start a local server.

**File Structure:**
The application consists of three main files: `index.html` contains the complete markup and form structure, `styles.css` provides all styling with mobile-first responsive design, and `script.js` handles form logic, validation, scoring, and data persistence.

**Submitting Changes:**
Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your changes. Write clear commit messages that describe what your changes accomplish. Include any necessary documentation updates and test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request.

**Types of Contributions We Value:**
Bug fixes and performance improvements are always appreciated. User interface enhancements that improve accessibility or usability help make the tool more inclusive. Additional validation logic or scoring improvements can make the assessment more accurate and helpful.

## Browser Compatibility

Project Scope Validator works in all modern web browsers that support ES6 features, CSS Grid, and Flexbox. This includes recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The application uses progressive enhancement principles, so core functionality remains available even if some advanced features aren't supported.

- ES6 JavaScript (arrow functions, template literals, const/let)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- sessionStorage for data persistence
- Modern form validation APIs
